# obmenu2
obmenu2 is a graphical menu editor for the Openbox menu.xml file.

It is written in Python 3 and GTK3 and is meant as a replacement for the old obmenu (http://obmenu.sourceforge.net/) tool which is based on the deprecated versions Python 2.7 and pygtk and pyglade.

It was written from scratch and does not share any code with the old obmenu tool.

# Dependencies
* Python 3 (tested with python 3.7)
* GTK3 (gobject-introspection)
